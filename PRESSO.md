# What is Telemetry Theory

OpenTelemetry is:
 - a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. 
 - Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior
 
 - in an open-source, vendor agnostic way
 - It is part on [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/) since 2019 and 2nd most active project after Kubernetes. Also a lot of high-cal contributors

It is extensible framework which supports [multiple languages ](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/#status-and-releases)and open-source data standard like you see in Prometheus, Jaeger as well as commercial vendors like DataDog, Splunk, etc

### Specification

### Basic:

---

Complex

## OpenTelemetry libraries
### For starters we just needf SDK which will do the basics
All you need is `opentelemetry/sdk` library to do the basics

## Define where to output the telemetry data
Open Telemetry Output can be to console, or to a collector (OTLP, Zipkin, Jager, etc)

```ruby
ENV['OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER'] = 'console'
```

## Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.service_name = "BASIC SERVICE"
end

MyAppTracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer('NAME_OF_YOUR_TRACER')

MyAppTracer.in_span("name of the span") do |span|
  # your code here
end
```
